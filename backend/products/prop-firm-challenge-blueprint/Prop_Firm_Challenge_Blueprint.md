## CHAPTER 1: UNDERSTANDING PROP FIRMS

### What is Proprietary Trading?

Proprietary (prop) trading firms trade their own capital. They recruit talented traders and provide them with firm capital in exchange for a profit split.

**Benefits for Traders**:
- Trade larger capital without personal risk
- Typically 70-90% profit split
- No personal capital at risk
- Potential for scaling

**The Modern Model**:
Most modern prop firms use an "evaluation" model:
1. You pay a fee for the evaluation
2. Trade a simulated account following rules
3. Pass evaluation → Get funded account
4. Trade profitably → Earn profit split

### Major Prop Firms

| Firm | Challenge Cost | Profit Target | Max Drawdown | Profit Split |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| FTMO | $155 (10K) | 10% | 10% | 80-90% |
| The5%ers | $260 (10K) | 6% | 4% | 50-100% |
| MyForexFunds | $84 (10K) | 8% | 12% | 75-85% |
| True Forex Funds | $79 (10K) | 8% | 10% | 80% |
| Funded Next | $99 (10K) | 10% | 10% | 80-90% |

*Prices and terms vary. Always check current offerings.*

### Typical Rules

**Phase 1 (Challenge)**:
- Hit profit target (e.g., 8-10%)
- Don't exceed daily loss limit (e.g., 5%)
- Don't exceed total drawdown (e.g., 10%)
- Minimum trading days (e.g., 5 days)

**Phase 2 (Verification)**:
- Lower profit target (e.g., 5%)
- Same drawdown rules
- Proves consistency

**Funded Account**:
- No profit target
- Same drawdown rules
- Withdraw profits monthly

## CHAPTER 2: CHOOSING THE RIGHT PROP FIRM

### Factors to Consider

**1. Rules That Match Your Style**
- Day trader? Need firm that allows overnight holds
- News trader? Need firm without news restrictions
- Scalper? Need firm that allows short holds

**2. Profit Target vs Drawdown**
- More aggressive firms: 10% target, 10% drawdown (1:1)
- Conservative firms: 6% target, 4% drawdown (1.5:1)
- Match to your strategy's expectancy

**3. Cost**
- Don't overspend on evaluations
- Start smaller ($10K-$25K accounts)
- Scale up after proving yourself

**4. Instrument Availability**
- Need XAUUSD? Check it's available
- Want to trade indices? Verify

**5. Payout Terms**
- How often can you withdraw?
- What's the minimum withdrawal?
- How fast are payouts processed?

### My Recommendation for Beginners

**Start with**:
- Account size: $10K-$25K
- Challenge cost: Under $200
- Profit target: 8-10%
- Drawdown: 10% total
- Daily loss: 5%

**Why**: Reasonable risk-reward, enough room for strategy execution, affordable to retry if failed.

- Daily loss limit: $5,000 (5%)
- Max loss: $10,000 (10%)
- Min trading days: 4

### Phase 2: Verification

**Objective**: Prove you can repeat success

**Timeline**: Usually 60 days

**Key Differences**:
- Lower profit target (usually 5%)
- Same loss limits
- Proves consistency, not luck

### Funded Stage

**Objective**: Trade profitably, get paid

**Rules**:
- No profit target (just don't lose)

## CHAPTER 5: STRATEGIES THAT PASS EVALUATIONS

### Strategy Characteristics for Evaluations

**What Works**:
- High probability setups (>50% win rate)
- Reasonable risk:reward (1.5:1 to 3:1)
- Consistent daily opportunities
- Clear, objective rules

**What Doesn't Work**:
- Martingale or averaging down
- Random entries hoping for luck
- Extremely rare setups
- Strategies requiring >5% per trade

### Strategy 1: Trend Pullback

**Concept**: Trade with the trend on pullbacks

**Setup**:
1. Identify trend on H4/Daily (EMA 50)
2. Wait for pullback to EMA on H1
3. Enter on bullish/bearish engulfing
4. SL below pullback low
5. TP at 2R

**Win Rate**: ~50-55%
**R:R**: 2:1
**Daily Opportunities**: 1-3

### Strategy 2: London Breakout

**Concept**: Trade the breakout of Asian range

**Setup**:
1. Mark Asian session high/low
2. At London open, wait for breakout
3. Enter on first clear break
4. SL other side of range
5. TP at 1.5x range width

**Win Rate**: ~45-50%
**R:R**: 1.5:1
**Daily Opportunities**: 1

### Strategy 3: Support/Resistance Bounce

**Concept**: Trade reversals at key levels

**Setup**:
1. Identify strong S/R from D1/H4
2. Wait for price to approach level
3. Enter on reversal candle pattern
4. SL beyond the level
5. TP at next S/R level

**Win Rate**: ~55-60%
**R:R**: 1.5:1 to 2:1
**Daily Opportunities**: 0-2

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Win Rate | R:R | Trades/Day | Best For |
|----------|----------|-----|------------|----------|
| Trend Pullback | 50-55% | 2:1 | 1-3 | Trending markets |
| London Breakout | 45-50% | 1.5:1 | 1 | Volatile opens |
| S/R Bounce | 55-60% | 1.5-2:1 | 0-2 | Range-bound |

## CHAPTER 6: RISK MANAGEMENT FOR EVALUATIONS

### The Golden Rule

**Never risk more than 1% per trade during evaluation**

Why? Math example:

- 10% drawdown limit
- 1% risk per trade
- You can lose 10 trades in a row and still be in the game
- At 2% risk, 5 losses = 10% drawdown = failed

### Daily Loss Management

**Set a daily loss limit BELOW the firm's limit**

Firm limit: 5%
Your limit: 3%

**Why**:
- Buffer for slippage
- Prevents emotional revenge trading
- Forces discipline

### The 3-Strike Rule

After 3 consecutive losses:
1. Stop trading for the day
2. Review what went wrong
3. Return tomorrow with fresh mindset

### Position Sizing Formula

```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / (Stop Loss in $ per lot)

Example:
$100,000 account × 0.75% = $750 max risk
Stop loss: 25 pips
Pip value: $10/pip per lot
Position = $750 / (25 × $10) = $750 / $250 = 3.0 lots
```

### Correlation Risk

Don't open multiple correlated positions:
- EURUSD long + GBPUSD long = 2x EUR risk
- XAUUSD long + XAGUSD long = 2x metals risk

**Rule**: If correlated, count as single position for risk

---

## CHAPTER 7: PSYCHOLOGY & DISCIPLINE

### The Evaluation Mindset

**Wrong Mindset**:
- "I need to hit 10% fast"
- "I'm down 3%, need to make it back today"
- "This looks like a good trade, I'll risk more"

**Right Mindset**:
- "I will execute my strategy perfectly"
- "I accept losses as part of the process"
- "I protect my capital above all"

### Common Psychological Traps

**1. Revenge Trading**
After a loss, wanting to "get it back"
Solution: Daily loss limit, walk away

**2. Overconfidence**
After wins, feeling invincible
Solution: Same risk every trade

**3. Fear of Failure**
Hesitating on valid setups
Solution: Trust your tested strategy

**4. Impatience**
Taking poor setups because "need to trade"
Solution: Quality over quantity

### The 30-Day Evaluation Mindset

**Week 1**: Execute perfectly, accept any result
**Week 2**: Stay consistent, don't force trades
**Week 3**: Maintain discipline even if behind
**Week 4**: Finish strong, no heroics

**Key Insight**: You have 30 days. There's no rush.

## CHAPTER 9: COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM

### Mistake 1: Overtrading

**The Problem**: Taking 10+ trades daily, most are poor quality

**The Solution**: 
- Maximum 3 trades per day
- Only A+ setups
- Quality over quantity

### Mistake 2: Risking Too Much

**The Problem**: 2-3% per trade leads to quick failure

**The Solution**:
- Maximum 1% per trade
- Even 0.5% is fine
- Slow and steady wins

### Mistake 3: No Trading Plan

**The Problem**: Random entries, no consistency

**The Solution**:
- Write detailed trading plan
- Only take trades matching plan
- Track adherence to plan

### Mistake 4: Moving Stop Loss

**The Problem**: Moving SL further away to "give it room"

**The Solution**:
- SL is calculated before entry
- Once set, never move away from entry
- Accept the loss if stopped

### Mistake 5: Revenge Trading

**The Problem**: After loss, immediately entering another trade to recover

**The Solution**:
- Wait minimum 30 minutes after loss
- Follow 3-strike rule
- Accept losses as normal

### Mistake 6: Trading News

**The Problem**: Getting stopped out by news spikes

**The Solution**:
- Check calendar daily
- No trades 30 min before high-impact news
- Close or reduce positions before news

### Mistake 7: Weekend Holding

**The Problem**: Gaps over weekend cause big losses

**The Solution**:
- Close all positions Friday afternoon
- Or significantly reduce size
- Avoid Sunday evening entries

### Mistake 8: Abandoning Strategy

**The Problem**: Switching strategies after 2-3 losses

**The Solution**:
- Test strategy before evaluation
- Commit to minimum 20 trades
- Losses are normal

## CHAPTER 10: POST-PASS SUCCESS

### You Passed - Now What?

**First Week Funded**:
- Same strategy, same risk
- Don't change anything
- Build initial profit buffer

**First Month Funded**:
- Aim for consistency, not max profit
- Small steady gains
- Build relationship with firm

### Scaling Your Account

Many firms offer scaling:
- Trade profitably for X months
- Get access to larger capital
- Example: $100K → $200K → $400K

**Focus on percentage returns**, not dollar amounts

### Managing Multiple Accounts

Once comfortable:
- Trade multiple prop firm accounts
- Same strategy across all
- Diversifies firm risk

### Building Long-Term Income

**Month 1-3**: Prove consistency, small withdrawals
**Month 4-6**: Scale account if available
**Month 7-12**: Regular monthly income

**Realistic Expectations**:
- 5% monthly on $100K = $5,000
- At 80% profit split = $4,000/month
- Very achievable with discipline

## BONUS: EVALUATION CALCULATOR

### Will Your Strategy Pass?

**Required Data**:
- Win rate: ___%
- Average winner: ___R
- Average loser: ___R (should be 1R)
- Trades per day: ___
- Risk per trade: ___%

**Expectancy Formula**:
```
Expectancy = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)

Example:
50% win rate × 2R = 1.0
50% loss rate × 1R = 0.5
Expectancy = 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5R per trade
```

**Evaluation Projection**:
```
If expectancy = 0.5R
Risk = 0.75% per trade
Expected per trade = 0.5 × 0.75% = 0.375%

2 trades per day = 0.75%
20 trading days = 15% expected profit

Even at 50% of expectation = 7.5% (passes 5% verification)
```

---

## FINAL WORDS

Passing a prop firm evaluation is achievable for any disciplined trader.

**Remember**:
1. Strategy matters less than discipline
2. Risk management is everything
3. Psychology is the real challenge
4. Consistency beats intensity
5. It's a marathon, not a sprint

You have the knowledge. Now execute.

Good luck, and see you on the funded side! 🎯
